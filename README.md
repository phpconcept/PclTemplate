# PclTemplate

PclTemplate is an easy template management class.

The template can be any text based file, or string. The generated result will use the parsed template and a data structure (arrays) to fill the tokens.

PclTemplate support conditional block of information (if/endif) and also loops (list/endlist). A template can also include an other template.
